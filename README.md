CS 330 Final Project: 3D Scene
Overview
This repository contains my final project for CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. The project includes the following components:

3D Scene ZIP Folder: Contains all files necessary to generate a 3D scene using C++ and OpenGL.
Design Decisions Document: A detailed explanation of the decisions made during the design and development process.
This project demonstrates my ability to create a fully realized 3D environment, apply computational graphics techniques, and navigate the software development lifecycle.

How Do I Approach Designing Software?
Designing software begins with understanding the problem or the goal of the project. For this 3D scene, I envisioned a peaceful garden with cylinder-shaped trees and lush green grass. I broke the design into smaller components, starting with sketching a basic layout and defining the visual elements I wanted to include. This project helped me enhance my skills in applying textures, setting up lighting, and organizing 3D objects to create a cohesive environment. Following a structured design process, including brainstorming, prototyping, and iterating based on feedback, was critical to my success.

In the future, I can apply this approach to other projects by starting with a clear vision, planning systematically, and refining my work through iterative testing and feedback.

How Do I Approach Developing Programs?
Developing programs is a systematic process of translating design concepts into working code. For this project, I used an incremental development strategy, focusing on creating and testing individual components before integrating them into the final scene. Iteration played a crucial role, as I frequently tested and refined my code to ensure that textures, lighting, and interactivity were implemented correctly.

Throughout the milestones, my coding approach evolved significantly. I learned to better utilize debugging tools and libraries to solve problems, and I gained confidence in breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps. By the project’s completion, I had a deeper understanding of OpenGL functions and a greater appreciation for clean, modular code.

How Can Computer Science Help Me Reach My Goals?
This project has given me a strong foundation in computational graphics and visualization, which I can apply to my future goals in both education and my professional pathway.

Educational Pathway: The skills I’ve gained, such as creating 3D environments and applying textures and lighting, will be invaluable in future coursework, particularly in data visualization or game development.
Professional Pathway: Computational graphics and visualization skills open doors to roles in fields like gaming, simulation, and interactive design. I’m particularly excited to explore how these skills can enhance data storytelling and help present complex information in intuitive ways.
Through this project, I’ve gained a new perspective on how computational graphics can bring creativity and technical precision together, equipping me with tools to tackle real-world challenges in my future endeavors.
